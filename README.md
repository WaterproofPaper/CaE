# CaE-Coins are Everything
# "Coins are Everything" Overview
"Coins are Everything" (CAE) is a mod that allows you to exchange Minecraft ***vanilla*** items into ***5 kinds of coins*** and use coins to get another items. 

## How it works?
Actually, we have a Minecraft server. In order to play EE2-ish mods on 1.14.4, we developed this mod. If you check it, you'll find that *the coin amount that every item exchanges is equal to its **EMC value.*** e.g. *A diamond can exchange 8192 stones.*  
    **Our current coin name:**  
        *1. Copper Coin;  
        2. Sliver Coin;  
        3. Gold Coin;  
        4. Few Gold Coins;  
        5. Many Gold Coins.**
