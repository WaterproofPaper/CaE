## How it works?
   Actually, we have a Minecraft server. In order to play EE2-ish mods on 1.14.4, we developed this mod. If you check it, you'll find that *the coin amount that every item exchanges is equal to its **EMC value.*** e.g. *A diamond can exchange 8192 stones.*  

   **Our current coin name:**  
        *1. Copper Coin;  
        2. Sliver Coin;  
        3. Gold Coin;  
        4. Few Coins;  
        5. Many Coins;    
        6. Super Coin.*
