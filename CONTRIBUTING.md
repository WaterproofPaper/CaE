# Hello there!
## If you come here...
You must be interested in this project, huh? OK. We can do some things together!  
So, according to **MIT License,** you are *completely* free to clone our projects to study or modify them.  
When you pull a request, you **must* write an expository text (use Markdown) to describe what has been modified or we will not merge it. A good example:  
  **Time: MM-DD-YY HH:mm  
  Developer(s): xxx, yyy, zzz
  What did you modified: 1. xxx; 2. xxx; ...**

That is it. Enjoy developing!
